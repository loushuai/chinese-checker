# Chinese Checker
This is a classic chess game which is very popular in Chinese.
In the game, each player takes one of the six conners on the board as the starting corner. The first player who fully occupies the corner on the opposite side is the winner.
For each turn, the player could move a piece to its empty neighbor position or jump over another piece (the player's own or the other player's). Multiple jump is allowed in the same turn.
At most 6 players can play at the same time. You could also add 1 or more AI players.
